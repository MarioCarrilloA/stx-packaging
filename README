This is a sample implementation of the StarlingX Flock Source Reorg.

Currently this will only build fault/fm-api and fault/fm-common package,
the rest are just templated as an example layout. 

It does currently require that the downloads directory requires having a
tarball called fm-api-1.0.tar.gz to build the Source RPM from.
